## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching approach emphasizes:
- **Practical Implementation**: Balancing theoretical foundations with hands-on coding experience
- **Real-World Applications**: Connecting ML/CV concepts to problems relevant to developing regions
- **Collaborative Learning**: Fostering peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and group problem-solving
- **Research-Oriented Thinking**: Encouraging students to think critically and explore open problems
